***The most difficult part of the project:***

- creating the database, and seeding the data.
- designing the front-end.

***Favourite part to work on:***
- learning more about the react and express, and how to debug the errors.
- styling the front-end.

***Future plans:***</br>
1- I would like to add the payment method cash, or by credit card.</br>
2- I would like to add a google map that will show the nearest flower stores to the user.</br>
3- i would like to add a filter menu to let the user to search the flower based on price, occasions,etc.</br>
